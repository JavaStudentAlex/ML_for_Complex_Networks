First the length of the route is equal to 0 if we had no movements from that node. The second point of metric properties will be pivotal: in the undirected graph the route from x to y can be not the same as y to x, that is why such a metric will not work as a measure with all properties. The third point is that x to y is less than x to z + z to y because the metric is the exact shortest path. If not than x -> z -> y is the shortest path."
