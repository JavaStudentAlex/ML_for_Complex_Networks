    "Let's define the adjacency matrix as the counter of the walks with length 1(exactly direct links). By multiplication A matrices with each other for each sell ij we take ith row and jth column from the same matrix and add multiplied elements. If the elements fulfill transition properties so the path exists and we take one more path with length 2. When we multiply the A * A * A we still get the A ^ 2 as the matrix of walks with length 2 and A as the matrix of walks with length 1. So the same transition property works every multiplication round and at the end in each cell, we get the number of walks with length k from i to j."

In another way, we start searching for another point that can be reached from this one. If the point also fulfills the condition then recursively repeat an action. If not - it is the border point. After finishing finding all points in the Eps region we extract the cluster."
