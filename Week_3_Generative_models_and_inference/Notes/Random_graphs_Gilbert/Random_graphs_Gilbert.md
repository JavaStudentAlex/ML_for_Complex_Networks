This paper, which appeared in the Journal of the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics, introduces the G(n,E) model (also known as the Gilbert model) of random graphs. This is a slight variant of the G(n,p) model, which was also introduced by Gilbert.

In the G(n,E) model, a graph is generated by starting with n isolated vertices, and then adding E edges chosen uniformly at random from the set of all possible edges.

This paper investigates several properties of such graphs, including the probability that a graph is connected, the expected number of isolated vertices, and the distribution of the sizes of the connected components. These results have important implications for network connectivity and reliability, among other applications.
