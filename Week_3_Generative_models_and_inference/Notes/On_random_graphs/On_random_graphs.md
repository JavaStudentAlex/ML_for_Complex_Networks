"On Random Graphs I," Erdős and Rényi introduced the Erdős–Rényi model for generating random graphs. They examined various properties of these graphs, such as graph connectivity and the emergence of a "giant component." Their findings provided the foundation for the field of random graph theory, with wide implications for the study of complex networks in various domains.
